"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad. Long live Professor Yunus. Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad.

"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad.

"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad. Long live Professor Yunus. Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours.

"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports.

Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026.

"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad. Long live Professor Yunus. Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad. Long live Professor Yunus. Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah.

"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad.

"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

"Next election between December and June, no scope to deviate from it even for a day: Rizwana","The interim government is performing three hard responsibilities - reforms, justice and elections, environment, forest and climate change affairs adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Friday. “Our responsibilities are broadly three, and all three are very difficult. One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad.

Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours. Our course of action will be based on their (government) activities.” “However, I want to make it loud and clear that the issue of me being sworn-in as mayor is completely different from our demand for the resignation of the student representatives from the advisory council. There has been no change in it.” He also asked for people’s forgiveness due to public sufferings caused by their programme. ""The government pushes us to such an extent by depriving us of our rights that we were compelled to announce such programmes as a last resort,"" he said, adding that their demonstrations will continue until advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam resign.","2025-05-23T16:27:39+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp mount pressur govern continu sitin programm parti leader say abl demonstr strength continu presenc parti activist support street day may demand swear ishraqu hossain citi mayor interim govern put even pressur programm apart barrier ishraqu hossain sworn mayor now party’ ultim target forc govern hold elect decemb year parti continu hold programm street holi eidulazha june sever reliabl sourc top level bnp told prothom alo parti sought time discuss overal situat chief advis interim govern tuesday howev respons thursday afternoon later afternoon bnp held emerg press confer demand resign two advis interim govern — asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam parti also demand resign nation secur advis khalilur rahman bnp said will ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern fail hold elect decemb year parti policymak keep eye step govern take context bnp demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam advisori council parti also demand resign nation secur advis chief advis high repres rohingya crisi khalilur rahman bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain rais demand press confer held polit offic bnp chairperson capital’ gulshan thursday said “ recent activ interim govern cast doubt neutral interim govern presenc advis wide known direct indirect involv new polit parti continu undermin govern imag nonpartisan neutral necessari reliev duti order maintain govern credibility” bnp foreign affair secretari ishraqu hossain rais demand address party’ sitin capital’ kakrail last wednesday also remark possibl hold free fair elect incumb govern bnp said press confer prudent limit advisori council handl routin work instead larg one regard secur advis bnp said written statement spark new controversi sake imag govern reliev duti bnp said ‘difficult’ keep support interim govern hold elect decemb year said govern carri spirit juli upris reestablish constitut right human right people’ right vote top prioriti now establish polit govern elect peopl countri soon possibl bnp demand specif roadmap hold free fair elect form new parliament decemb year prime agenda incumb govern parti claim otherwis difficult bnp keep support interim govern interim govern maintain highest level neutral sake antifascist uniti howev appear implement agenda certain quarter gain polit advantag becom part govern plan bnp alleg elect commiss ec subject unfair question publish gazett regard dhaka south citi corpor mayor bnp stand committe member khandak mosharraf hossain said press confer hope govern will soon make arrang ishraq hossain sworn mayor dhaka south citi corpor complianc verdict elect tribun high court hc order criticis interim govern bnp said written statement “ observ recent time cultur act pressur rather requir govern time manner complianc public expect alreadi undermin government’ credibl digniti encourag peopl realis demand similar way liabil unwarr embarrass situat lie entir government” said “ reform continu process elect prepar reform can go simultan trial fallen fascist forc relev peopl parti will continue” khandak mosharraf hossain said unfortun issu rais press confer remain ignor case bnp will reconsid whether will continu support interim govern bnp stand committe member abdul moyeen khan amir khasru mahmud chowdhuri salahuddin ahm present press confer sitin programm city’ kakrail matsya bhaban adjac demand bnp leader ishraqu hossain mayor post call declar came hour start sitin follow ishraqu hossain start nonstop sitin wednesday morn part protest start may day support ishraqu hold demonstr sitin front nagar bhaban may lock sever offic hous nagar bhaban main gate disrupt sever servic center nagar bhaban first protest demand resign asif mahmud shojib bhuyain later start chant slogan demand resign advis mahfuj alam soon high court dismiss writ seek stay order elect commiss gazett declar ishraqu mayor yesterday protest brought process chant differ slogan support ishraqu ishraqu hossain went kakrail intersect around pm call sitin said “follow high court verdict parti decid call sitin will observ govern activ next hour cours action will base govern activities” “howev want make loud clear issu swornin mayor complet differ demand resign student repres advisori council chang ” also ask people’ forgiv due public suffer caus programm govern push us extent depriv us right compel announc programm last resort said ad demonstr will continu advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam resign"
"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Prothom Alo wins Best in South Asia award","Prothom Alo has received global recognition for its courageous journalism during the July mass uprising, youth reader engagement, and subsequent initiatives. Prothom Alo received the ‘Best in South Asia’ award at the INMA Global Media Awards 2025 by the International News Media Association (INMA), the largest global platform of media organisations. Six initiatives from six different regions across the world were selected as winners, and Prothom Alo was chosen from South Asia. The Global Media Awards recognise innovative initiatives and best practices in media around the world and these awards are considered the highest international recognition for media organisations. Prothom Alo also won two more awards in two categories at the INMA Global Media Awards.  Prothom Alo won first place in the Best Idea to Encourage Reader Engagement (national brand) category, followed by Grupo El Comercio from Peru and Schibsted from Norway. Prothom Alo also won third prize for its National Health Olympiad initiative in the Best Use of an Event to Build a News Brand (national brand) category. Dow Jones from the US and Hindustan Times from India bagged the first and the second places. The awards were presented at the Global Media Congress held at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 9:00 pm. local time on Thursday (7:00 am Friday Bangladesh time). Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman received the award. He said that Prothom Alo’s reporting during the July uprising was a reflection of courageous journalism. Various multifaceted follow-up initiatives of Prothom Alo were extraordinary, thus, this media organisation bagged this top international recognition. The International News Media Association (INMA), which comprises more than 1,000 media outlets from 93 countries, has been recognising various outstanding media initiatives around the world since 1937. The 2025 Global Media Awards competition attracted 839 entries from 286 market-leading news media brands in 49 countries.  Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. An international jury of 60 media executives from 26 countries selected 198 finalists earlier this year. Alongside Prothom Alo, this year’s winners include The Washington Post and The Boston Globe from the US, The Financial Times from the UK, The Toronto Star from Canada, Amedia from Norway, The Waikato Times from New Zealand, Prisa Media and Vocento from Spain, NTM from Sweden, Alma Media from Finland, RBS Group from Brazil, The Hindu, Jagran Prakashan, and ABP from India, News Corporation from Australia, and South China Morning Post from Hong Kong, among others. The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, won second prize in the ‘Best Commerce Product or Service’ category for its e-learning initiative ‘Keeron.’ Previously, Prothom Alo also bagged honours in this global competition. Prothom Alo received an honourable mention in 2021, a first place and a second place in 2022, a second prize and an honourable mention in 2023, and a second prize, a third prize, and an honourable mention in 2024. Prothom Alo continuously published objective news in print, digital, and social media platforms during the student-led mass uprising in July–August 2024. Prothom Alo became the primary source of accurate news for the readers because of this truthful and courageous reporting. In the 36 days of the movement (from 1 July to 5 August), Prothom Alo’s online version, Prothomalo.com, received 310 million page views. Prothomalo.com recorded 350 million page views in August alone, which was a milestone for any Bangladeshi media outlet. Among the 310 million page views during the 36 days, Gen Z (Generation Z) readers made up 43 per cent of the audience, with an engagement rate of 74.52 per cent. The newspaper’s print circulation rose by 200,000 copies during this time. Prothom Alo created a digital respiratory of reports, interviews, slogans, opinions, graffiti, photos, and videos published during the July–August uprising. The site includes a 36-day timeline and 24 selected stories of the martyrs like Abu Sayed, Mugdho, and Farhan, as well as the survivors. The digital archive provides at-a-glance information on casualties and special exhibitions and memorabilia related to the July uprising.  Prothom Alo objectively covered the events, documented deaths, and published humanitarian and analytical reports from the beginning. Stories of rebellion, pain, and heroism emerged through these reports. Images of state repression were also boldly published online and in print. The digital respiratory is titled ‘July Mass Uprising 2024, accessible at https://services.prothomalo.com/bidrohe-biplobe/. People from all walks of life participated in the student-led movement in July–August. These events were captured not only by professional journalists and photographers, but also by common people. Prothom Alo launched a reader engagement campaign called ‘Rebellion in the camera’ on its 26th anniversary to collect these rare and daring photos and videos. Readers submitted their own photos and videos to the campaign. From over 1,000 submissions, 10 photos and 10 videos were judged for prizes. To highlight the uprising of people from all walks of life, Prothom Alo also published a special supplement titled ‘Bidrohe Biplobe, four regional supplements, four special issues for its 26th anniversary, three video documentaries, a July awakening exhibition, a painting of martyr Abu Sayed, a photojournalism book Mukto Koro Bhoi, and six books from Prothoma Prakashon, as well as many initiatives throughout the year. The “Health Olympiad” was organised involving school students from 12 regions with the aim of spreading health awareness across the country. The initiative, conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and supported by USAID, sought to disseminate various health-related information among students of Prothom Alo School and to raise awareness and prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Students participated in the competition through exams, wall magazines, and other creative activities and successfully spread awareness about tuberculosis and general health among themselves, their families, and their communities. The INMA Awards give special recognition to excellence in areas such as the use of newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, reader engagement, subscription models, artificial intelligence (AI), business innovation, and data insights. INMA selects the top initiatives from its six regional platforms—Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Asia—for consideration in the Global Media Awards. The highest recognition at the 2025 Global Media Awards, the ‘Best in Show’ award, was won by Ukraine’s The Association of Independent Regional Press Publishers, who provided extensive support to the country’s regional publishers during the ongoing war. Speaking about the initiative, INMA CEO and executive director Earl J Wilkinson said the Global Media Awards showcased how media companies are breaking away from long-standing norms to better connect with readers in today’s rapidly changing and often challenging news landscape. “This year’s winners are among the most creative and inspiring we’ve seen,” he added.","2025-05-23T22:35:06+06:00","bangladesh","prothom alo receiv global recognit courag journal juli mass upris youth reader engag subsequ initi prothom alo receiv ‘best south asia’ award inma

"Annoyance after creating complications is not acceptable: Anu Muhammad","The interim government should formulate the necessary ideological, political, and economic policies to move toward a non-discriminatory Bangladesh, Anu Muhammad, a member of the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee (Democratic Rights Committee), said on Friday. Instead of taking steps toward that goal, the government is creating complications by diverting focus and getting annoyed, which is not acceptable, he stated. Anu Muhammad made the remarks while presiding over a discussion, “Post-mass uprising Bangladesh: What kind of budget do we want?”, organised by the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee at the National Press Club this afternoon. Describing the interim government as temporary, Anu Muhammad, also a former Professor of Economics at Jahangirnagar University, said that it does not have a permanent “mandate” and will not remain in power for long. Therefore, many things are not possible for this government. He, however, believes the government can initiate momentum toward change aligned with the vision of a non-discriminatory Bangladesh. Stating that people are working hard and wealth is being generated and consequently there is no lack of money, this economics professor remarked that public control over resources can only be established once a non-discriminatory society is achieved, which was a promise of the government. Instead of moving toward fulfilling that commitment, the government is focusing on foreign companies, foreign investments, Starlink, and LNG imports—areas that should not be their priority, he further said. According to him, the government should focus on building national capacity, making necessary changes in education and culture, reforming agriculture and industry, and strengthening environment-friendly ways for the people; formulating the required ideological, political, and economic policies essential for this. “Creating complications by taking the wrong direction and then becoming offended is not warranted,” he pointed out. Anu Muhammad also criticised a few recent government decisions, stating, instead of trying to build national capacity, for instance, the Chittagong port is being handed over to foreign companies. The chief adviser announced it must be done at any cost. In another case, he said, the high representative (chief adviser’s representative on Rohingya issues) has dubbed the proposed “humanitarian corridor” as a “relief channel”. These are the same issues. All the issues, including agreement with Starlink, are being presented as alternatives to building national capacity, he pointed out. He argued that the government could have taken steps to eliminate institutional weaknesses at Chittagong port, including sending people abroad for training. Enhancing national capacity at the Chittagong port would have a long-term and stable effect. Emphasising the need to strengthen national capacity in the upcoming budget, Anu Muhammad said the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) chairman suddenly signed an LNG import agreement about which Petrobangla was not aware. “That was not supposed to happen,” he observed. Mentioning that the country needs to boost national capacity for gas extraction but no initiatives have been taken in the past nine months, he said the upcoming budget must include this. He called for a shift in perspective and policy to enhance national capacity, which would reduce gas and electricity costs and eliminate the need for expensive imports and subsidies. Anu Muhammad also mentioned that human resources at railway workshops in Saidpur, Parbatipur, and Chattogram have been reduced, which made it necessary to import engines, coaches, and wagons. “If the workshops had been strengthened, it would have been possible to manufacture all those domestically.” He also demanded increased budget allocation for training and research to build national capacity. According to him, Bangladesh’s spending in these areas is among the lowest in the world. Although many universities and research institutes have been established, there is little effort or initiative to conduct research aligned with national needs, he added. He also supported changing the fiscal year (currently July–June) to align with the Bangla calendar or the January–December period. “The current fiscal year ends during the monsoon season, which leads to waste and inefficiencies in development work.” Other speakers at the event included Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee members Maha Mirza, Kallol Mostafa, Harun Ur Rashid, Moshahida Sultana, Mahtab Uddin Ahmed, Sajib Tanvir, Marzia Prova, Kaushik Ahmed, and Salman Siddiqui.","2025-05-23T21:26:04+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern formul necessari ideolog polit econom polici move toward nondiscriminatori bangladesh anu muhammad member ganatantrik odhikar committe democrat right committe said friday instead take step toward goal govern creat complic divert focus get annoy accept state anu muhammad made remark presid discuss “postmass upris bangladesh kind budget want” organis ganatantrik odhikar committe nation press club afternoon describ interim govern temporari anu muhammad also former professor econom jahangirnagar univers said perman “mandate” will remain power long therefor mani thing possibl govern howev believ govern can initi momentum toward chang align vision nondiscriminatori bangladesh state peopl work hard wealth generat consequ lack money econom professor remark public control resourc can establish nondiscriminatori societi achiev promis govern instead move toward fulfil commit govern focus foreign compani foreign invest starlink lng imports—area prioriti said accord govern focus build nation capac make necessari chang educ cultur reform agricultur industri strengthen environmentfriend way peopl formul requir ideolog polit econom polici essenti “creat complic take wrong direct becom offend warranted” point anu muhammad also criticis recent govern decis state instead tri build nation capac instanc chittagong port hand foreign compani chief advis announc must done cost anoth case said high repres chief adviser’ repres rohingya issu dub propos “humanitarian corridor” “relief channel” issu issu includ agreement starlink present altern build nation capac point argu govern taken step elimin institut weak chittagong port includ send peopl abroad train enhanc nation capac chittagong port longterm stabl effect emphasis need strengthen nation capac upcom budget anu muhammad said bangladesh invest develop author bida chairman sudden sign lng import agreement petrobangla awar “ suppos happen” observ mention countri need boost nation capac gas extract initi taken past nine month said upcom budget must includ call shift perspect polici enhanc nation capac reduc gas electr cost elimin need expens import subsidi anu muhammad also mention human resourc railway workshop saidpur parbatipur chattogram reduc made necessari import engin coach wagon “ workshop strengthen possibl manufactur domestically” also demand increas budget alloc train research build nation capac accord bangladesh’ spend area among lowest world although mani univers research institut establish littl effort initi conduct research align nation need ad also support chang fiscal year current july–jun align bangla calendar january–decemb period “ current fiscal year end monsoon season lead wast ineffici develop work” speaker event includ ganatantrik odhikar committe member maha mirza kallol mostafa harun ur rashid moshahida sultana mahtab uddin ahm sajib tanvir marzia prova kaushik ahm salman siddiqui"
"‘Several political parties not letting Prof Yunus work’","Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s chief organiser of Chattogram city Tawsif Imroz said Professor Muhammad Yunus has been brought in as the chief adviser to lead state reform in exchange for the blood of the July martyrs.  “But several political parties are not letting him work properly. I want to say to those who are obsessed with power that you are still serving those who serve Awami League,” he said. Tawsif Imroz made the remarks at a protest rally organised by the July Okya Chattogram in front of the Chattogram Press Club after Juma prayers on Friday. Before that, leaders and activists of the platform brought out a procession from the port city’s Anderkilla Shahi Jame Mosque after Juma prayer. July Okya Chattogram chief coordinator Abrar Hasan, National Citizens Party (NCP) central committee member Zubairul Alam, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement’s Chattogram chapter senior joint convener Ibne Hossain and joint organising secretary Rashedul Alam, among other, spoke at the event. The procession from Anderkilla Shahi Jame Masjid began at 2:00 pm and passed through Cheragi Mor before ending at the Press Club intersection, followed by holding a rally. On 6 May, July Okya, comprising 35 organisations, was launched with a demand to ban the Awami League over the July killings. Abrar Hasan said, “A quarter from inside and outside the country is conspiring against the nation. Efforts are being made to destabilise the country under Indian planning,. We want to make it clear—if there's an attempt to sabotage July, there will be another July. The July Charter must be published immediately. Those hiding behind the scenes must be exposed. If there's an attempt to bring back the Awami League, there will be another revolution.” Speakers said only 20 out 30-working day deadline remain and the July Charter must be announced within it. Those who want to make the Awami League as the main opposition in the next elections will not be allowed to succeed. Everyone must remain united on the demand of the trial of Awami League.

One responsibility is reform, one is dispensing justice, and the other is election,” she told newspersons after attending the 24th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Bangladesh Zoological Society at the Senate Building of Dhaka University today. “Our responsibility is a national one. We said we have taken responsibility, not power. It will be possible for us to perform it only when we all get cooperation from all,” she said. She said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has given a timeframe for the next election between December 2025 and June 2026. “There is no scope to deviate from it even for a day,” the adviser said, adding that she believes that there should be no scope to talk about it in any other way. Rizwana said after yesterday’s advisory council meeting at Jamuna they discussed for a long time on their own performance. “We discussed whether we are actually delivering our responsibilities for which we were deputed,” she said. Since assuming office by the interim government, she said many people with their manifold demands are coming to the streets out of their expectation from the government. But, street demonstrations are leading Dhaka city to become paralysed, she said adding, “expectation is one thing but responsibility is another.” “We all are thinking about how to deal with the obstacles to perform the three major responsibilities,” the environment adviser said. Rizwana said, they are not under any pressure except their stress for discharging their responsibilities. “If we are unable to perform our responsibilities, we will go back to our own business,” she said. The adviser stated that they have come across a long way amid many adverse situations. “We have formed reform commissions, which have already submitted their reports. The process is underway to reach a consensus among the political parties on the reform agenda,” the adviser said. Rizwana said the government has announced a timeframe for the elections, which will definitely be held between December next and June 2026. Regarding the quick trial of the persons for their offenses during the July uprising, Rizwana said earlier there was one tribunal and now another one has been constituted, which will start functioning soon.","2025-05-23T18:28:48+06:00","bangladesh","interim govern perform three hard respons reform justic elect environ forest climat chang affair advis syeda rizwana hasan said friday “ respons broad three three difficult one respons reform one dispens justic election” told newsperson attend th nation confer annual general meet bangladesh zoolog societi senat build dhaka univers today “ respons nation one said taken respons power will possibl us perform get cooper ” said said chief advis professor muhammad yunus given timefram next elect decemb june “ scope deviat even day” advis said ad believ scope talk way rizwana said yesterday’ advisori council meet jamuna discuss long time perform “ discuss whether actual deliv respons deputed” said sinc assum offic interim govern said mani peopl manifold demand come street expect govern street demonstr lead dhaka citi becom paralys said ad “expect one thing respons another” “ think deal obstacl perform three major responsibilities” environ advis said rizwana said pressur except stress discharg respons “ unabl perform respons will go back business” said advis state come across long way amid mani advers situat “ form reform commiss alreadi submit report process underway reach consensus among polit parti reform agenda” advis said rizwana said govern announc timefram elect will definit held decemb next june regard quick trial person offens juli upris rizwana said earlier one tribun now anoth one constitut will start function soon"
"Amended ICT rules of procedure narrates process of trying organisation","The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has brought amendment to its rules of procedure, narrating the method of trying an organisation under the act. ICT prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim told BSS that the provision of trying and punishing an organisation was brought earlier by amending the ICT Act, but this latest amendment, which will be called “International Crimes Tribunal-1 Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025” has explained the method of trying that organisation and those, from that accused organisation, can represent it at the tribunal during the trial. “...if cognisance is taken against any organisation, summons/warrant shall be served upon the President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary of the person (s) in charge of the concerned organisation. The organisation shall be represented by its President/Chairman/Chairperson or Secretary or any other member of the executive committee and accordingly the said person(s) may be made liable, if deemed expedient by the Tribunal, to be inflicted with punishment for violation of or disobedience to any order of the Tribunal in relation to or arising out of any order passed under the Act and/or Rules,” the Rule-30 said. Earlier on 22 May, the ICT-1 published the amended rules of procedure, keeping provision for the investigation officer or a prosecutor designated in probing a case, to arrest any accused or suspect. “If the investigation officer has reason to believe that any offence has been committed, he shall proceed in person to the spot, investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and may arrest the accused(s)/suspected persons and make necessary discovery. The investigation officer may also seek assistance from the law enforcing agency in causing arrest, discovery and seizure,” said Rule-6 of the amended rules of procedure. “But they have to produce the arrestee before the tribunal or any magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest,” prosecutor Tamim added. “If any member of the Investigation Agency makes a petition to any Judicial Magistrate of the first class for recording any statement of witness, that Magistrate shall record such statement,” said Rule-24. In line with the rules of procedure, the ICT chief prosecutor will be able to bring multiple accused under trial simultaneously or he will be able to try them separately. If multiple allegations are proved in the probe against a single accused, the chief prosecutor will be able to try multiple allegations simultaneously by filing a formal charge, the prosecutor further said. Welcoming the amendment in the ICT rules of procedure, prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim said the prosecution believes this will help the tribunal become of more international standard.","2025-05-23T22:37:30+06:00","bangladesh","intern crime tribun ict brought amend rule procedur narrat method tri organis act ict prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim told bss provis tri punish organis brought earlier amend ict act latest amend will call “intern crime tribun rule procedur amend ” explain method tri organis accus organis can repres tribun trial “ cognis taken organis summonswarr shall serv upon presidentchairmanchairperson secretari person s charg concern organis organis shall repres presidentchairmanchairperson secretari member execut committe accord said person may made liabl deem expedi tribun inflict punish violat disobedi order tribun relat aris order pass act andor rules” rule said earlier may ict publish amend rule procedur keep provis investig offic prosecutor design probe case arrest accus suspect “ investig offic reason believ offenc commit shall proceed person spot investig fact circumst case may arrest accusedssuspect person make necessari discoveri investig offic may also seek assist law enforc agenc caus arrest discoveri seizure” said rule amend rule procedur “ produc arreste tribun magistr within hour arrest” prosecutor tamim ad “ member investig agenc make petit judici magistr first class record statement wit magistr shall record statement” said rule line rule procedur ict chief prosecutor will abl bring multipl accus trial simultan will abl tri separ multipl alleg prove probe singl accus chief prosecutor will abl tri multipl alleg simultan file formal charg prosecutor said welcom amend ict rule procedur prosecutor gazi monawar hossain tamim said prosecut believ will help tribun becom intern standard"
"Army provides list of 626 people who took shelter in cantonments","The Bangladesh Army has clarified its position regarding the individuals who sought refuge in cantonments during the aftermath of the student-led uprising.  According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday, the primary objective of extending shelter to these individuals was to protect them from potential extrajudicial killings, based on humanitarian considerations. The statement noted that most of those who took refuge in the cantonments left within a day or two, depending on how the situation evolved.  However, five individuals were later handed over to law enforcement agencies following legal procedures, based on existing allegations or cases against them. According to the ISPR, after the collapse of the previous government during the July–August 2024 student-people’s uprising, the overall law and order situation deteriorated significantly due to the activities of certain disruptive groups.  This period saw widespread unrest, including attacks on government offices and police stations, violence against political leaders and activists, arson, mob justice, theft, and looting. In such a volatile and fragile environment, widespread fear and insecurity took hold among the public. The press release stated that citizens from various sectors—including political figures—sought protection in cantonments across the country, including in Dhaka. Given the urgency of the unfolding crisis, the army prioritised safeguarding the lives of those seeking refuge over verifying their identities. In total, 626 people were given shelter, including 24 political figures, 5 judges, 19 civil administration officials, 515 police personnel, Officials from various public universities, 12 individuals categorised as “miscellaneous”, 51 family members (wives and children). The ISPR press release further stated that an official statement had already been issued on 18 August regarding those who had sought refuge in the cantonments. On the same day, a list of 193 individuals—excluding 432 general police members and one NSI official—was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The matter was considered settled at the time. The individuals and their family members who had taken shelter were provided temporary refuge from a humanitarian standpoint, with the aim of ensuring their safety and protecting their lives. The statement read: “Given the prevailing security situation at that time, there was every possibility that the lives of the asylum seekers would be at risk. Unfortunately, some vested interests are now deliberately spreading misleading information to tarnish the image of the Bangladesh Army and create a sense of division between the military and the public. In this context, a complete list of 626 individuals—including 432 ordinary police members and one NSI officer—who took refuge inside various cantonments following the July–August mass uprising, is attached to this press release.” The army reaffirmed its commitment to stand by the nation with professionalism, dedication, and trust, while safeguarding the sovereignty of the country. According to the ISPR notification, the political figures who took shelter in the cantonments included Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Shamsul Haque Tuku, Shajahan Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Sayedul Haque Sumon, Tanvir Hasan Saikat, Chhoto Monir, Iqbalur Rahim, Ragibul Hasan Ripu, AKM Rezaul Karim Tansen, MA Latif, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, Habibun Nahar, Ekramul Haque Titu, Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, Abu Zahir, and others.","2025-05-23T11:41:14+06:00","bangladesh","bangladesh armi clarifi posit regard individu sought refug canton aftermath studentl upris accord press releas issu interservic public relat ispr thursday primari object extend shelter individu protect potenti extrajudici kill base humanitarian consider statement note took refug canton left within day two depend situat evolv howev five individu later hand law enforc agenc follow legal procedur base exist alleg case accord ispr collaps previous govern july–august studentpeople’ upris overal law order situat deterior signific due activ certain disrupt group period saw widespread unrest includ attack govern offic polic station violenc polit leader activist arson mob justic theft loot volatil fragil environ widespread fear insecur took hold among public press releas state citizen various sectors—includ polit figures—sought protect canton across countri includ dhaka given urgenc unfold crisi armi prioritis safeguard live seek refug verifi ident total peopl given shelter includ polit figur judg civil administr offici polic personnel offici various public univers individu categoris “miscellaneous” famili member wive children ispr press releas state offici statement alreadi issu august regard sought refug canton day list individuals—exclud general polic member one nsi official— sent ministri home affair matter consid settl time individu famili member taken shelter provid temporari refug humanitarian standpoint aim ensur safeti protect live statement read “given prevail secur situat time everi possibl live asylum seeker risk unfortun vest interest now deliber spread mislead inform tarnish imag bangladesh armi creat sens divis militari public context complet list individuals—includ ordinari polic member one nsi officer— took refug insid various canton follow july–august mass upris attach press release” armi reaffirm commit stand nation profession dedic trust safeguard sovereignti countri accord ispr notif polit figur took shelter canton includ shirin sharmin chaudhuri shamsul haqu tuku shajahan khan zunaid ahm palak sayedul haqu sumon tanvir hasan saikat chhoto monir iqbalur rahim ragibul hasan ripu akm rezaul karim tansen ma latif kazi nabil ahm talukd abdul khalequ habibun nahar ekramul haqu titu anwaruzzaman chowdhuri abu zahir other"
"Chief adviser not to resign, country needs him: Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb","Special adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb has said interim government’s chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus will not resign. He (Yunus) does not need power; but Professor Yunus is required for Bangladesh’s democratic transition. The chief adviser’s special adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology wrote this in his Facebook page on Friday. He told Prothom Alo that what he has written in his Facebook wall is his personal opinion. Following is his full Facebook post: “The Chief Advisor will not resign. Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus does not need power, but Dr. Yunus sir is essential for Bangladesh, for a peaceful democratic transition in Bangladesh. Rather, the cabinet has to be more dynamic. The government has to be more functional, the advisers must work more, and visible progress must be presented to the public—there can be no disagreement on this. We must show that the professor has shown success by coming to power with public consent after the people’s uprising. Dr. Muhammad Yunus is respected by the international community, and it is our duty to uphold that respect. I believe the government must now engage in more in-depth dialogue with political parties, hold regular meetings, and seek their opinions on various issues. Any kind of isolation is not warranted. At the same time, the military must not interfere in politics. In today’s world, no civilised nation’s military engages in politics. Therefore, the Army Chief could not maintain jurisdictional correctness through speaking about elections by December. However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. No hasty or reckless action should be taken regarding the military. Likewise, in the name of inclusiveness a rehabilitation of the Awami League must not be sought. The Bangladesh Army is a source of our pride and trust—no one will be allowed to break that. I hope that, after completing the necessary preparations, elections will be held sometime in April-May; but this is my personal opinion. During this time, all reasonable reforms must be completed, including the July Charter. However, according to the roadmap from December to June, announcing the exact date of the election is solely within Sir’s (Dr Yunus’) jurisdiction. No one else can hijack that authority. When Sir was requested to take the chair, he said at the airport: ‘you have to listen to me’. In July-August 2025, we will nationally celebrate the first anniversary of the July people’s uprising, Insha’Allah. And I also hope that by August, the first verdict in the trial of the autocratic killer Hasina will be delivered. Insha’Allah we will not lose, and we cannot be defeated. Inquilab Zindabad. Long live Professor Yunus. Long live Bangladesh.”","2025-05-23T17:26:24+06:00","bangladesh","special advis faiz ahmad taiyeb said interim government’ chief advis professor muhammad yunus will resign yunus need power professor yunus requir bangladesh’ democrat transit chief adviser’ special advis post telecommun inform technolog wrote facebook page friday told prothom alo written facebook wall person opinion follow full facebook post “ chief advisor will resign professor dr muhammad yunus need power dr yunus sir essenti bangladesh peac democrat transit bangladesh rather cabinet dynam govern function advis must work visibl progress must present public— can disagr must show professor shown success come power public consent people’ upris dr muhammad yunus respect intern communiti duti uphold respect believ govern must now engag indepth dialogu polit parti hold regular meet seek opinion various issu kind isol warrant time militari must interfer polit today’ world civilis nation’ militari engag polit therefor armi chief maintain jurisdict correct speak elect decemb howev militari must shown due respect kept confid hasti reckless action taken regard militari likewis name inclus rehabilit awami leagu must sought bangladesh armi sourc pride trust— one will allow break hope complet necessari prepar elect will held sometim aprilmay person opinion time reason reform must complet includ juli charter howev accord roadmap decemb june announc exact date elect sole within sir’ dr yunus’ jurisdict one els can hijack author sir request take chair said airport ‘ listen ’ julyaugust will nation celebr first anniversari juli people’ upris insha’allah also hope august first verdict trial autocrat killer hasina will deliv insha’allah will lose defeat inquilab zindabad long live professor yunus long live bangladesh”"
"Frustrated and angry, chief advisor talks of ""resigning""","Chief advisor of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed anger and frustration at the prevailing situation in the country. He went as far as saying, what was the use of remaining of the office of chief advisor if he could perform his duties properly. Professor Yunus discussed the overall situation of the country with other advisors in an unscheduled discussion on Thursday afternoon, following a regular meeting of the Advisory Council. During the conversation, he expressed his anger and disappointment. This has been confirmed through conversations with multiple advisors of the interim government and a senior official in a high level of the administration.  After the meeting of the advisory council, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. He visited the Chief Adviser’s residence, Jamuna, in the evening. After leaving, Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla later that night that Professor Muhammad Yunus was ""considering resignation."" Earlier, following the advisory council meeting, the chief advisor talked for long with the advisors. Sources present at the meeting told Prothom Alo that topics discussed included the daily road blockades in Dhaka due to protests, lack of consensus among political parties on reforms and other issues, and various parties' non-cooperation in state affairs. At one point, the chief adviser expressed his inability to function effectively and raised the question of why he should remain in office if meaningful reforms are not taking place. Sources present at the meeting further reported that at one stage the chief adviser told them they should consider forming another interim government, as he wishes to step down. He also expressed doubts about whether it would be possible to conduct a free and fair election under the current circumstances. He questioned whether the police and administration would be able to prevent incidents such as ballot snatching if the election was held under these conditions. He said if the election was not conducted properly, the public would blame him. According to meeting sources, the chief adviser suggested delivering a speech to the nation to highlight the issue of non-cooperation from various quarters. At one point, a draft of the speech was even prepared. However, no final decision was made regarding the speech, and it may be discussed again later. In the evening, Nahid Islam, the convener of the National Citizens Party (NCP), met with the chief advisor. Later, advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam also visited Jamuna to meet with the chief advisor. Several sources within the NCP told Prothom Alo that Nahid Islam entered Jamuna around 7:00 pm and had an exclusive conversation with the chief advisor that lasted for some time. Nahid Islam himself confirmed the meeting with the chief advisor to Prothom Alo. Meanwhile, BBC Bangla reported at night that Nahid Islam went to meet Professor Muhammad Yunus after hearing that the chief advisor might resign. He told BBC, ""Given the ongoing situation in the country, and the news we’ve been hearing since this morning about Sir possibly resigning, I went to meet him to discuss that issue."" Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla that the chief advisor expressed concern that he may not be able to continue working under the current circumstances in the country. He said, “Sir said, ‘If I can’t do my job… You brought me in after a mass uprising, hoping for change and reform in the country. But the way things are unfolding—the protests, and the way I am being held hostage—I cannot function like this.’” Saying that the chief adviser as “considering resignation,” Nahid Islam told BBC Bangla, “He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation has become such that he will not be able to carry out his responsibilities.” However, Nahid Islam, the NCP convener, has urged the chief adviser not to take a decision as drastic as resignation. On this point, he said, “Considering the aspirations of the mass uprising, national security, and the future of the country, we urged him to stay strong and remain in unity with all parties. We hope everyone will cooperate with him.”","2025-05-23T12:52:32+06:00","bangladesh","chief advisor interim govern professor muhammad yunus express anger frustrat prevail situat countri went far say use remain offic chief advisor perform duti proper professor yunus discuss overal situat countri advisor unschedul discuss thursday afternoon follow regular meet advisori council convers express anger disappoint confirm convers multipl advisor interim govern senior offici high level administr meet advisori council nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor professor muhammad yunus visit chief adviser’ resid jamuna even leav nahid islam told bbc bangla later night professor muhammad yunus consid resign earlier follow advisori council meet chief advisor talk long advisor sourc present meet told prothom alo topic discuss includ daili road blockad dhaka due protest lack consensus among polit parti reform issu various parti noncooper state affair one point chief advis express inabl function effect rais question remain offic meaning reform take place sourc present meet report one stage chief advis told consid form anoth interim govern wish step also express doubt whether possibl conduct free fair elect current circumst question whether polic administr abl prevent incid ballot snatch elect held condit said elect conduct proper public blame accord meet sourc chief advis suggest deliv speech nation highlight issu noncooper various quarter one point draft speech even prepar howev final decis made regard speech may discuss later even nahid islam conven nation citizen parti ncp met chief advisor later advis asif mahmud shojib bhuyain mahfuj alam also visit jamuna meet chief advisor sever sourc within ncp told prothom alo nahid islam enter jamuna around pm exclus convers chief advisor last time nahid islam confirm meet chief advisor prothom alo meanwhil bbc bangla report night nahid islam went meet professor muhammad yunus hear chief advisor might resign told bbc given ongo situat countri news ’ve hear sinc morn sir possibl resign went meet discuss issu nahid islam told bbc bangla chief advisor express concern may abl continu work current circumst countri said “sir said ‘ can’t job… brought mass upris hope chang reform countri way thing unfolding— protest way held hostage— function like ’” say chief advis “consid resignation” nahid islam told bbc bangla “ said think feel situat becom will abl carri responsibilities” howev nahid islam ncp conven urg chief advis take decis drastic resign point said “consid aspir mass upris nation secur futur countri urg stay strong remain uniti parti hope everyon will cooper ”"
"BNP mounts pressure on government","Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has mounted pressure on the government through their continuous sit-in programmes. The party's leaders say they have been able to demonstrate their strength through the continuous presence of party activists and supporters on the street for 9 days from 14 to 22 May, demanding the swearing in of Ishraque Hossain as the city mayor. The interim government has been put under even more pressure with these programmes. Apart from that, there are no more barriers for Ishraque Hossain to be sworn in as the mayor. Now the party’s ultimate target is to force the government to hold the elections by December this year. For this, the party is to continue holding programmes on the streets after the holy Eid-ul-Azha in June. Several reliable sources at the top level of BNP told Prothom Alo the party sought time to discuss the overall situation with the chief adviser of the interim government on Tuesday. However, there has been no response as of Thursday afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the BNP held an emergency press conference demanding the resignation of two advisers to the interim government — Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam. The party also demanded the resignation of national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. The BNP has said that it will be ‘difficult’ for them to keep supporting the interim government if it fails to hold the election by December this year. The party's policymakers are keeping an eye on what steps the government takes in such a context. The BNP has demanded resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam from the advisory council. The party also has demanded the resignation of national security adviser to the chief adviser and high representative on the Rohingya crisis, Khalilur Rahman. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain raised the demands in a press conference held at the political office of BNP chairperson in the capital’s Gulshan on Thursday. He said, “Some recent activities of the interim government have cast doubt over the neutrality of the interim government. The presence of advisers who are widely known to be directly or indirectly involved with a new political party continues to undermine the government's image as non-partisan and neutral. So it is necessary to relieve them of their duties in order to maintain the government's credibility.” Before that, BNP foreign affairs secretary Ishraque Hossain raised the same demands while addressing the party’s sit-in in the capital’s Kakrail last Wednesday. He also remarked that it would not be possible to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. The BNP said in the press conference that it is prudent to have a limited advisory council to handle routine work instead of a large one. Regarding the security adviser, the BNP said in its written statement that he had sparked new controversy. So for the sake of the image of the government, he should be relieved from his duties. The BNP said it would be ‘difficult’ to keep supporting the interim government if it could not hold elections by December this year. It further said the government should carry the spirit of the July uprising to re-establish constitutional rights, human rights and people’s right to vote. So, the top priority now should be to establish a political government elected by the people of the country as soon as possible. BNP demanded a specific roadmap for holding a free and fair election to form a new parliament by December this year. This should be the prime agenda of the incumbent government, the party claimed. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the BNP to keep supporting the interim government. The interim government should have maintained the highest level of neutrality for the sake of anti-fascist unity. However, it appears that implementing the agenda of certain quarters to gain political advantage has become part of the government's plan. The BNP further allege that the Election Commission (EC) is being subjected to unfair questions for publishing the gazette regarding Dhaka South City Corporation mayor. BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said at the press conference that they hope the government will soon make arrangement for Ishraq Hossain to be sworn in as the Mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation in compliance with the verdict of the election tribunal and the High Court (HC) order. Criticising the interim government, the BNP said in its written statements, “It has been observed in recent times that the culture of acting under pressure rather than doing what is required of the government in a timely manner in compliance with public expectations has already undermined the government’s credibility and dignity. It is further encouraging people to realise their demand in a similar way. The liability of such an unwarranted and embarrassing situation lies entirely with the government.” It further said, “As reform is a continuous process, so the election preparations and reform can go simultaneously. The trial of the fallen fascist force and other relevant people and parties will continue.” Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said it would be unfortunate if the issues raised in the press conference remain ignored as before. In that case, the BNP will have to reconsider whether they will continue to support the interim government or not. BNP standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed were present in the press conference. The sit-in programmes in the city’s Kakrail and Matsya Bhaban and adjacent demanding BNP leader Ishraque Hossain in the mayoral post have been called off. The declaration came after more than 31 hours of starting the sit-in. Followers of Ishraque Hossain started the non-stop sit-in from Wednesday morning, as part of their protest which started 14 May. From that day, the supporters of Ishraque had been holding demonstrations and sit-ins in front of the Nagar Bhaban. On 15 May, they locked up several offices housed in Nagar Bhaban and the main gate which disrupted several services centering the Nagar Bhaban. At first the protesters demanded the resignation of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain. Later, they started chanting slogans demanding resignation of the adviser Mahfuj Alam. As soon as the High Court dismissed the writ seeking a stay order on the Election Commission gazette declaring Ishraque as the mayor yesterday, the protesters brought out processions chanting different slogans supporting Ishraque. Ishraque Hossain went to Kakrail intersection around 4:00 pm. There, he called off the sit-in and said, “Following the High Court verdict, the party has decided to call off the sit-in. We will be observing government activity for the next 24-48 hours.

"NCP warns against ‘biased’ EC","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has accused the Election Commission (EC) of acting in a biased manner to appease a particular political party and has demanded its immediate restructuring.  The party also called for the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure accountability of the EC. The demands were raised at a protest rally organised by the NCP’s Jatrabari zone unit in Dhaka South City, held at the Jatrabari intersection on Thursday afternoon. The rally was part of the NCP’s ongoing campaign demanding local government elections and a restructured Election Commission. Addressing the rally, NCP Central Joint Member Secretary Nizam Uddin said, “From the very beginning, the Election Commission has acted with clear bias to please one political party. The EC, formed under a controversial law from a fascist regime, must be overhauled. We also demand the formation of an independent Supreme Judicial Council to ensure its accountability.” NCP Joint Member Secretary Alauddin Mohammad accused the BNP of trying to capitalise on the current situation. “They want to bring about another 1/11 in Bangladesh. The judiciary and the Election Commission, which once contributed to destabilisation through 1/11, must be reformed,” he said. NCP Joint Chief Organiser Ali Naser Khan alleged that BNP was attempting to seize power undemocratically by toppling the government formed through the people’s uprising.  “Before any reforms began, BNP appointed election commissioners and attorney generals. It also placed its people in key positions across the judiciary, bureaucracy, and other state institutions. Although there’s talk of a level playing field, the reality is far from it. The EC must be restructured,” he asserted. SM Shahriar, NCP’s Joint Chief Coordinator, said the current Election Commission has no intention of upholding democracy. Another Joint Chief Coordinator, Muhammad Mursalin, claimed, “The EC has now effectively become the party office of the BNP. Everyone knows who opposes the July Declaration. Out of the 30 working days announced by the government, 21 remain. If the declaration is not issued within this time, we will launch a strong mass movement.” Other speakers at the rally included Kadamtali Police Station representatives Md. Sadiqul Islam and Rabiul Islam, Jatrabari Police Station representatives Lucky Akhter, Mirasad Hossain, and Md. Riyad, as well as Rifat Khan from Wari Police Station. As the movement demanding that BNP leader Ishraque Hossain be sworn in as the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) gains momentum, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has intensified its own call for local government elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission (EC). Both BNP and NCP have also echoed demands for the resignation of five government advisers. Amid these developments, a notable shift in tone was observed on social media, with NCP leaders beginning to call for unity among the forces behind the July mass uprising. At around 5:00 pm yesterday, Mahfuz Alam, information adviser to the interim government, posted a message on his verified Facebook account that struck a conciliatory note. “I sincerely regret any previous statements and wording that were divisive. If I have another day in government, I want to work with respect and sensitivity to all the forces of the uprising,” he wrote. Several prominent NCP leaders reposted Mahfuz Alam’s message, which was also shared by numerous leaders from the Bangladesh Gonotantrik Chhatra Sangsad. By the evening, the call for unity had spread more widely across NCP ranks. Hasnat Abdullah, the party’s chief organiser for the southern region, posted: “There is no alternative to being united—not for the interests of any individual or group, but for our country.” Senior Joint Chief Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud joined the chorus with a symbolic post featuring Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem Kandari Hushiar, offering a poetic appeal for solidarity. Later in the evening, at around 7:00 pm, NCP convener Nahid Islam paid a private visit to the chief adviser’s residence in Jamuna.

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States."" ""The Chinese side has consistently opposed the politicization of educational cooperation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. Harvard has already sued the US government over a separate raft of punitive measures. Karl Molden, a student at Harvard from Austria, said he had applied to transfer to Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP Thursday, calling his admission to Harvard the ""greatest privilege"" of his life. Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the decision ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education.""","2025-05-23T20:00:02+06:00","international","harvard su trump administr friday move block prestigi univers enrol host foreign student broaden disput court file show thursday homeland secur secretari kristi noem revok harvard univers abil enrol foreign nation throw futur thousand student doubt presid donald trump furious harvard produc nobel prize winner reject demand submit oversight admiss hire claim hotb antisemit woke liber ideolog administr alreadi threaten put billion govern fund harvard review gone freez first tranch billion grant million offici contract well target harvard medic school research deport latest act govern clear retali harvard exercis first amend right reject govern demand control harvard govern curriculum ideolog faculti student said lawsuit file massachusett feder court loss foreign nation quarter student bodi prove cost harvard charg ten thousand dollar year tuition harvard presid alan garber said statement friday condemn unlaw unwarr action imperil futur thousand student scholar across harvard serv warn countless other colleg univers throughout countri come america pursu educ fulfil dream said just file complaint motion temporari restrain order will follow noem said thursday administr hold harvard account foster violenc antisemit coordin chines communist parti campus chines student make fifth harvard intern enrol accord univers figur beij said decis will harm imag intern stand unit state chines side consist oppos politic educ cooper foreign ministri spokeswoman mao ning said harvard alreadi su us govern separ raft punit measur karl molden student harvard austria said appli transfer oxford britain fear measur scari sadden yearold govern classic student told afp thursday call admiss harvard greatest privileg life leader harvard chapter american associ univers professor call decis latest string nake authoritarian retaliatori move america oldest institut higher educ"
"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that."" ""I would hope maybe there's going to be a legal battle that'll take place.""","2025-05-23T11:33:50+06:00","international","donald trump administr thursday revok harvard abil enrol foreign nation quarter student bodi dramat escal us presid fight prestigi univers school cambridg massachusett quick slam move unlaw said hurt campus countri one student said communiti panick trump furious harvard produc nobel prize winner reject demand submit oversight admiss hire claim hotb antisemit woke liber ideolog loss larg proport student bodi prove huge financi blow harvard charg ten thousand dollar year tuition effect immedi harvard univers student exchang visitor sevi program certif revok homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote letter ivi leagu institut refer main system foreign student permit studi unit state harvard su govern separ raft punit measur quick fire back call move unlaw fulli commit maintain harvard abil host intern student scholar said statement ad work offer student guidanc support retaliatori action threaten serious harm harvard communiti countri undermin harvard academ research mission karl molden intern student austria said appli studi oxford britain fear measur scari sadden yearold govern classic student told afp love harvard get school greatest privileg life definit go chang percept student might consid studi us get less attract spot higher educ leader harvard chapter american associ univers professor call move latest string nake authoritarian retaliatori move america oldest institut higher educ trump administr unlaw seek destroy higher educ unit state now demand sacrific intern student process univers acquiesc extort said last month trump threaten stop harvard enrol foreign student agre govern demand put privat institut outsid polit supervis explain april letter privileg enrol foreign student noem wrote univers must compli depart homeland secur requir includ report requir student exchang visitor program regul maintain privileg said result refus compli multipl request provid depart homeland secur pertin inform perpetu unsaf campus environ hostil jewish student promot prohama sympathi employ racist divers equiti inclus polici lost privileg percent harvard enrol made foreign student academ year accord univers data fourthyear us student alic goyer told afp one know develop mean intern student alreadi enrol just got news ive get text lot intern friend think everyon just one know said everyon panick bit whether student will transfer institut suggest noem letter goyer said doubt peopl hope mayb there go legal battl thatll take place"

India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States.""

President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States."" ""The Chinese side has consistently opposed the politicization of educational cooperation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. Harvard has already sued the US government over a separate raft of punitive measures. Karl Molden, a student at Harvard from Austria, said he had applied to transfer to Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP Thursday, calling his admission to Harvard the ""greatest privilege"" of his life.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life.

Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that."" ""I would hope maybe there's going to be a legal battle that'll take place.""","2025-05-23T11:33:50+06:00","international","donald trump administr thursday revok harvard abil enrol foreign nation quarter student bodi dramat escal us presid fight prestigi univers school cambridg massachusett quick slam move unlaw said hurt campus countri one student said communiti panick trump furious harvard produc nobel prize winner reject demand submit oversight admiss hire claim hotb antisemit woke liber ideolog loss larg proport student bodi prove huge financi blow harvard charg ten thousand dollar year tuition effect immedi harvard univers student exchang visitor sevi program certif revok homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote letter ivi leagu institut refer main system foreign student permit studi unit state harvard su govern separ raft punit measur quick fire back call move unlaw fulli commit maintain harvard abil host intern student scholar said statement ad work offer student guidanc support retaliatori action threaten serious harm harvard communiti countri undermin harvard academ research mission karl molden intern student austria said appli studi oxford britain fear measur scari sadden yearold govern classic student told afp love harvard get school greatest privileg life definit go chang percept student might consid studi us get less attract spot higher educ leader harvard chapter american associ univers professor call move latest string nake authoritarian retaliatori move america oldest institut higher educ trump administr unlaw seek destroy higher educ unit state now demand sacrific intern student process univers acquiesc extort said last month trump threaten stop harvard enrol foreign student agre govern demand put privat institut outsid polit supervis explain april letter privileg enrol foreign student noem wrote univers must compli depart homeland secur requir includ report requir student exchang visitor program regul maintain privileg said result refus compli multipl request provid depart homeland secur pertin inform perpetu unsaf campus environ hostil jewish student promot prohama sympathi employ racist divers equiti inclus polici lost privileg percent harvard enrol made foreign student academ year accord univers data fourthyear us student alic goyer told afp one know develop mean intern student alreadi enrol just got news ive get text lot intern friend think everyon just one know said everyon panick bit whether student will transfer institut suggest noem letter goyer said doubt peopl hope mayb there go legal battl thatll take place"

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States."" ""The Chinese side has consistently opposed the politicization of educational cooperation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. Harvard has already sued the US government over a separate raft of punitive measures. Karl Molden, a student at Harvard from Austria, said he had applied to transfer to Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said.

"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.""

"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"".

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.""

Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States.""

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States."" ""The Chinese side has consistently opposed the politicization of educational cooperation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. Harvard has already sued the US government over a separate raft of punitive measures. Karl Molden, a student at Harvard from Austria, said he had applied to transfer to Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP Thursday, calling his admission to Harvard the ""greatest privilege"" of his life.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said.

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.""

Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States.""

"Harvard sues Trump over block on foreign students","Harvard sued the Trump administration on Friday over its move to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting foreign students in a broadening dispute, a court filing showed. On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. The loss of foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of its student body -- could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement Friday that ""we condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. ""It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams,"" he said. ""We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow."" Noem had said Thursday that ""this administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."" Chinese students make up more than a fifth of Harvard's international enrollment, according to university figures, and Beijing said the decision will ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States."" ""The Chinese side has consistently opposed the politicization of educational cooperation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. Harvard has already sued the US government over a separate raft of punitive measures. Karl Molden, a student at Harvard from Austria, said he had applied to transfer to Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP Thursday, calling his admission to Harvard the ""greatest privilege"" of his life.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students into doubt. President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation. ""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" said the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said.

"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that.""

President Donald Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. His administration has already threatened to put $9 billion of government funding to Harvard under review, gone on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts, as well as targeting a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected.

"Modi says Pakistan will not get water from Indian-controlled rivers","Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, upping the rhetoric in a standoff over water access triggered by a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan's chief legal officer, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islamabad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to a decades-old treaty. India said last month it was suspending the Indus Waters Treaty in a slew of measures after the 22 April attack in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad - a charge Pakistan dismisses. Any move to stop Pakistan accessing the water would have a devastating impact. The Indus treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, guarantees water for 80 per cent of Pakistan's farms from three rivers that flow from India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have already clashed in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on 10 May. ""Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ... Pakistan's army will pay it. Pakistan's economy will pay it,"" Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. ""Pakistan is willing to talk about or to address anything, any concerns they may have,"" Pakistan's Attorney General, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters. He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty. Islamabad maintains the treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said. ""As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,"" he added. The ceasefire between the countries has largely held. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were no current exchanges of fire and ""there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly"". ""The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message ... that if there are acts of the kind we saw on 22 April, there will be a response. We will hit the terrorists,"" Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,"" he added. India and Pakistan have shared a troubled relationship since they were carved out of British India in 1947, and have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist separatists in Kashmir, a claim Islamabad denies. Five people, including three children were killed in a suicide bomb blast on an army school bus in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. Pakistan's prime minister and military accused ""Indian terror proxies"" of involvement, which India rejected. Both nations have retaliated since the April attack by halting trade, closing borders and suspending most visas.","2025-05-23T13:25:32+06:00","international","pakistan will get water river india right indian prime minist narendra modi said thursday up rhetor standoff water access trigger dead attack indian kashmir pakistan chief legal offic interview reuter respond islamabad remain will discuss water share neighbour said india must stick decadesold treati india said last month suspend indus water treati slew measur april attack indian kashmir new delhi blame islamabad charg pakistan dismiss move stop pakistan access water devast impact indus treati negoti world bank guarante water per cent pakistan farm three river flow india nucleararm neighbour alreadi clash worst militari fight near three decad agre ceasefir may pakistan will pay heavi price everi terrorist attack pakistan armi will pay pakistan economi will pay modi said public event northwestern state rajasthan border pakistan pakistan will talk address anyth concern may pakistan attorney general mansoor usman awan told reuter said india written pakistan recent week cite popul growth clean energi need reason modifi treati said discuss take part term treati islamabad maintain treati legal bind parti can unilater suspend awan said far pakistan concern treati much oper function anyth india cost peril far build hydroelectr power project concern ad ceasefir countri larg held indian foreign minist subrahmanyam jaishankar said current exchang fire reposit forc accord militari oper continu clear messag act kind saw april will respons will hit terrorist jaishankar told dutch news outlet nos terrorist pakistan will hit ad india pakistan share troubl relationship sinc carv british india fought three war two himalayan region kashmir claim full rule part india accus pakistan back islamist separatist kashmir claim islamabad deni five peopl includ three children kill suicid bomb blast armi school bus pakistan restiv balochistan provinc wednesday pakistan prime minist militari accus indian terror proxi involv india reject nation retali sinc april attack halt trade close border suspend visa"
"Dismayed Chinese students ponder prospects after Trump Harvard ban","Dismayed Chinese students feared for their international futures on Friday after US President Donald Trump revoked Harvard University's right to enrol foreign nationals. The sharp escalation in Trump's longstanding feud with the elite Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues. Around 1,300 Chinese students are currently enrolled at Harvard, according to official figures, and hundreds of thousands more attend other universities in a country long viewed by many in China as a beacon of academic freedom and rigour. Admissions consultant Xiaofeng Wan, who advises overseas students on getting into top US universities, told AFP he had been on the phone with panicked clients all evening. ""I've got questions not only from families but also from school-based college counsellors in China as well, including principals of high schools,"" Wan said, speaking by phone from Massachusetts. ""They were all shocked by the news. They could not believe that this actually happened."" On the streets of Beijing on Friday, budding international students told AFP they feared their scholarly ambitions were now hanging in the balance. ""I'm a bit panicked to be honest,"" said Jennifer, who was planning to attend college in the United States this autumn. While she did not intend to apply to Harvard, ""budget cuts and enrollment restrictions affect all universities in the United States, regardless of where you apply"", said the 20-year-old, who declined to give her surname. Jennifer said she worried Trump's policies would ""affect my chances of getting admitted"" to her top choice, Ohio State University, which said last month that the federal government had revoked the visas of at least seven of its international students. ""My classmates and I feel like we don't have any particularly good solutions to this issue, other than being pessimistic,"" she said. Trump has blasted Harvard for refusing to submit to government oversight on admissions and hiring, and has repeatedly claimed it is rife with anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that Thursday's move would also hold Harvard ""accountable for... coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus"", without giving details. In a swift response, Harvard slammed the revocation as ""unlawful"". China's foreign ministry was quick to criticise the move on Friday, saying the ban would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"". The number of Chinese students at American universities has been declining in recent years but still stood at nearly 280,000 in the 2023-24 academic year, according to figures from the US State Department and the Institute of International Education. Entire industries have sprung up in China in recent decades as millions of people have risen into the middle class and ploughed money into lucrative foreign educations for their children. ""There's a great sense of panic among the international student community, both current and prospective,"" said Wan, the Massachusetts-based consultant. They are ""concerned that the country of the US is closing the door on them"", he said. ""(It's) not helpful for a country that thrives on talents from abroad... and whose fundamental engine in research is supported by international talent.""","2025-05-23T18:31:55+06:00","international","dismay chines student fear intern futur friday us presid donald trump revok harvard univers right enrol foreign nation sharp escal trump longstand feud elit cambridg massachusettsbas colleg came tension simmer washington beij trade issu around chines student current enrol harvard accord offici figur hundr thousand attend univers countri long view mani china beacon academ freedom rigour admiss consult xiaofeng wan advis oversea student get top us univers told afp phone panick client even ive got question famili also schoolbas colleg counsellor china well includ princip high school wan said speak phone massachusett shock news believ actual happen street beij friday bud intern student told afp fear scholar ambit now hang balanc im bit panick honest said jennif plan attend colleg unit state autumn intend appli harvard budget cut enrol restrict affect univers unit state regardless appli said yearold declin give surnam jennif said worri trump polici affect chanc get admit top choic ohio state univers said last month feder govern revok visa least seven intern student classmat feel like dont particular good solut issu pessimist said trump blast harvard refus submit govern oversight admiss hire repeat claim rife antisemit woke liber ideolog us homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote x thursday move also hold harvard account coordin chines communist parti campus without give detail swift respons harvard slam revoc unlaw china foreign ministri quick criticis move friday say ban harm imag intern stand unit state number chines student american univers declin recent year still stood near academ year accord figur us state depart institut intern educ entir industri sprung china recent decad million peopl risen middl class plough money lucrat foreign educ children there great sens panic among intern student communiti current prospect said wan massachusettsbas consult concern countri us close door said help countri thrive talent abroad whose fundament engin research support intern talent"
"US govt revokes Harvard's right to enroll foreign students","Donald Trump's administration on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals -- more than a quarter of the student body -- in a dramatic escalation of the US president's fight against the prestigious university. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts quickly slammed the move as ""unlawful"" and said it would hurt both the campus and the country, while one student said the community was ""panicking."" Trump is furious at Harvard -- which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners -- for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and ""woke"" liberal ideology. The loss of such a large proportion of the student body could prove to be a huge financial blow to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ""Effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) Program certification is revoked,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States. Harvard, which has sued the government over a separate raft of punitive measures, quickly fired back, calling the move ""unlawful."" ""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was working to offer students guidance and support. ""This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission."" Karl Molden, an international student from Austria, said he had applied to study at Oxford in Britain because he feared such measures. ""It's scary and it's saddening,"" the 21-year-old government and classics student told AFP. ""I love Harvard, and getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life. ""It's definitely going to change the perception of... students who (might) consider studying there -- the US is getting less of an attractive spot for higher education."" Leaders of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors called the move ""the latest in a string of nakedly authoritarian and retaliatory moves against America's oldest institution of higher education."" ""The Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to destroy higher education in the United States. It now demands that we sacrifice our international students in the process. Universities cannot acquiesce to such extortion,"" it said.  Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision. ""As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students,"" Noem wrote. ""All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege,"" she said. ""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege."" More than 27 percent of Harvard's enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data. Fourth-year US student Alice Goyer told AFP ""no one knows"" what the development would mean for international students already enrolled. ""We just got the news, so I've been getting texts from a lot of international friends, and I think everyone's just -- no one knows,"" she said. ""Everyone's panicking a bit."" On whether students would willingly transfer to other institutions, as suggested by Noem in the letter, Goyer said, ""I doubt people would do that."" ""I would hope maybe there's going to be a legal battle that'll take place.""","2025-05-23T11:33:50+06:00","international","donald trump administr thursday revok harvard abil enrol foreign nation quarter student bodi dramat escal us presid fight prestigi univers school cambridg massachusett quick slam move unlaw said hurt campus countri one student said communiti panick trump furious harvard produc nobel prize winner reject demand submit oversight admiss hire claim hotb antisemit woke liber ideolog loss larg proport student bodi prove huge financi blow harvard charg ten thousand dollar year tuition effect immedi harvard univers student exchang visitor sevi program certif revok homeland secur secretari kristi noem wrote letter ivi leagu institut refer main system foreign student permit studi unit state harvard su govern separ raft punit measur quick fire back call move unlaw fulli commit maintain harvard abil host intern student scholar said statement ad work offer student guidanc support retaliatori action threaten serious harm harvard communiti countri undermin harvard academ research mission karl molden intern student austria said appli studi oxford britain fear measur scari sadden yearold govern classic student told afp love harvard get school greatest privileg life definit go chang percept student might consid studi us get less attract spot higher educ leader harvard chapter american associ univers professor call move latest string nake authoritarian retaliatori move america oldest institut higher educ trump administr unlaw seek destroy higher educ unit state now demand sacrific intern student process univers acquiesc extort said last month trump threaten stop harvard enrol foreign student agre govern demand put privat institut outsid polit supervis explain april letter privileg enrol foreign student noem wrote univers must compli depart homeland secur requir includ report requir student exchang visitor program regul maintain privileg said result refus compli multipl request provid depart homeland secur pertin inform perpetu unsaf campus environ hostil jewish student promot prohama sympathi employ racist divers equiti inclus polici lost privileg percent harvard enrol made foreign student academ year accord univers data fourthyear us student alic goyer told afp one know develop mean intern student alreadi enrol just got news ive get text lot intern friend think everyon just one know said everyon panick bit whether student will transfer institut suggest noem letter goyer said doubt peopl hope mayb there go legal battl thatll take place"

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade.

ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time.

In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time.

What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events.

Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition.

Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending?

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies).

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do?

A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade.

ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

"A corridor or reaching relief to Rakhine, poses the  same risks","Major General ANM Muniruzzaman (retd) is the president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. In an interview with Prothom Alo's AKM Zakaria and Rafsan Galib, he talks about the situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state, the debate over a corridor to Rakhine, and the impact of the India-Pakistan war.   There has been plenty of debate over a humanitarian corridor to the Rakhine state in Myanmar. In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time.

In the meantime, national security advisor Khalilur Rahman has said that Bangladesh will not be granting any such corridor. However, at the same time he said that the United Nations has made a request about sending relief to the Rakhine state through Bangladesh. What is the difference between the two, or is it the same thing? Whether we call it a humanitarian corridor or the delivering relief,  the issue is essentially the same. In this case, the national security advisor has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word ""corridor"" has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine State. The national security advisor may have assumed that the people of Bangladesh wouldn’t understand, but it's not right to take the public as fools. Let me make it clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Only the name is different. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief. It is evident from the national security advisor's words that talks and activities are on regarding a corridor to Rakhine or reaching relief there. Who are these talks being held with, and at what level, and how long have they been going on? There is no transparency whatsoever in this entire process. We’ve heard conflicting statements from various responsible figures in the government. The national security adviser says one thing, the foreign affairs advisor another, and the chief advisor’s press secretary yet another. It is unclear wither the discussions are with any foreign state or with the United Nations, or at what level these discussions occurred. What is clear, however, is that the relevant stakeholders were not consulted before making such a decision. If the parliament were in session, this matter would have required discussion before reaching a decision. Since there is no parliament, it would have been appropriate to consult with political parties and take their opinions into account. But that did not happen, and there is no sign of transparency in this matter. Prothom Alo :  The army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman has made his stand against the corridor clear. He said that it is for an elected government to take a decision regarding the corridor. Does that indicate that the armed forced were not consulted or their views were not taken into cognizance about this issue? ANM Muniruzzaman I believe that the military was not consulted or their opinion was not sought on this matter. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no transparency, nor any effort to engage stakeholders in discussion. Sending relief aid to a state in Myanmar carries significant security risks. Since security is a concern here, the position, opinion, and consent of the armed forces are extremely important. If we get involved in the process of sending relief, we could find ourselves in serious danger. We don’t even know whether Myanmar has given its consent to the delivery of relief to the Rakhine State. We have diplomatic relations with Myanmar and recognise it as an independent and sovereign country. If Myanmar has not consented to the relief delivery in Rakhine, it could resist the move in the interest of its national security and territorial integrity. That could lead to loss of lives and property. Who will provide security in such a scenario? And who will take responsibility for this? Even if aid is sent, there is no guarantee it will actually reach the people it is intended for. Past experiences suggest that in such situations, aid is often seized by separatist or armed groups that control the region, who then use it for their own purposes. The aid, in effect, becomes a tool of war. Has any final decision been made regarding the reaching relief aid to Myanmar's Rakhine State, or is the decision still pending? The national security advisor’s statement remains ambiguous. From the national security advisor’s statement, it appears that the government is, in principle, prepared to send relief to Rakhine. However, it is unclear how this will be implemented on the ground. Since the army chief does not agree with the plan, questions will also arise about how security in that region will be ensured. The area is highly sensitive, and if proper coordination is not maintained among the country's state forces, national security could be put at risk. Prothom Alo :  Myanmar has historic ties with China and is ostensibly controlled by China. The Arakan Army which is engaged in an armed struggle against the Myanmar government, is in control of Rakhine. So isn't it vital to understand China's stance before Bangladesh decides to send relief to the Arakan Army-controlled Rakhine? What do you think China's views will be about this? ANM Muniruzzaman China will not view the initiative to send relief to Rakhine favourably. The Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh recently voiced clear opposition to this initiative during a seminar organised by BIISS (Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies). If China considers Bangladesh’s initiative to be strategically against its interests, it will oppose it in various ways and attempt to block it. Prothom Alo :  What risks is the Myanmar situation creating for Bangladesh? What can Bangladesh do? ANM Muniruzzaman The ongoing internal conflict in Rakhine poses a significant threat to our national security. Such conflicts tend to spill over into surrounding regions, and that has already begun to happen. We have seen Myanmar’s soldiers fleeing into Bangladesh. At various times, the presence of the Arakan Army within Bangladesh’s territory has also been a topic of discussion. Bangladesh shares a 270 km border with Myanmar, and there is now a growing concern over the stability of that border. Questions have been raised about how border security will be maintained, especially since the border with Myanmar is now under the control of the Arakan Army, which is not a state force. This has complicated efforts to ensure security along the border. Altogether, there is now a pressing need for increased surveillance and oversight in the border areas. When instability arises in these regions, incidents such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking tend to increase. For this reason, border patrol must be further strengthened. Coming to the India-Pakistan war, what was the consequence of this? It is not possible to determine any military outcome from the India-Pakistan conflict. A ceasefire between the two countries was reached through US mediation before any military conclusion could be drawn. However, we must understand the threat this conflict poses to regional stability. The confrontation between these two countries highlights just how fragile the region’s stability has become. And such instability directly affects the economy and trade. Both countries possess nuclear capabilities and have two of the world’s largest armed forces. As a result, if war breaks out between them, it will not remain confined to the regional level. It could have far-reaching international consequences. Prothom Alo :  What lessons can we learn from this war? ANM Muniruzzaman Since both countries are our neighbors, we now need to reconsider all strategic aspects to help maintain regional stability. The areas of mutual cooperation that once existed within South Asia are barely functioning anymore. Everyone must now think about how a revival of SAARC. For the first time, water has been used as a weapon of war in this region. The Indus Waters Treaty signed between the two countries in 1960 has effectively collapsed for the first time. From Pakistan, we heard that if India does not supply water as per the treaty, it would be considered a red line for them. Similarly, India has stated that if anyone is hostile toward them, they cannot guarantee water access. This conflict, therefore, sends a strong signal to all downstream countries, and we must remain vigilant about this issue. Prothom Alo :  India has been continuously escalating its disputes with Bangladesh. What will be the outcome of this? What does India hope to gain from it? ANM Muniruzzaman It is clear that they want to exert pressure on Bangladesh in various ways. That is why we are seeing multiple restrictions on trade. They have also started pushing Indian citizens across different border points. India still cannot accept the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh and the subsequent events. In fact, they have yet to properly assess the changed situation in Bangladesh. For this reason, they are opposing us in various ways. These kinds of steps from India are a result of that opposition. However, I want to say that, as a neighbouring country, we need to prioritise good relations with India. India should also focus on building effective and positive relations with us. Imports, exports, trade and commerce, visa procedures, and people-to-people contacts are breaking down. This will not bode well for either country. Instead of hostility, both countries must build neighbourly relations based on mutual respect. Prothom Alo :  Thank you.

Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

"We are in the midst of challenges: Finance advisor","Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has said that they were in the midst of all sorts of challenges. ""Many criticise us, call us useless,"" he said, adding, ""It is fine if you criticise us, but this does not give a good impression to outside. It harms the image."" Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt.

Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

"We are in the midst of challenges: Finance advisor","Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has said that they were in the midst of all sorts of challenges. ""Many criticise us, call us useless,"" he said, adding, ""It is fine if you criticise us, but this does not give a good impression to outside. It harms the image."" Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt.

Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again. In this seventh edition of the event, five participants were awarded at the national level from among 20,000 competitors across the country. They were presented with smartphones and laptops as gifts. These five will represent Bangladesh at the International Economics Olympiad in Azerbaijan.","2025-05-23T15:02:20+06:00","business","financ advisor salehuddin ahm said midst sort challeng mani criticis us call us useless said ad fine criticis us give good impress outsid harm imag speak forthcom budget said talk sort tax cut will answer question day budget easi determin like common man social prefer   time intern monetari fund imf impos want reach solut financ advisor salehuddin ahm made remark speak chief guest   nation final bangladesh econom olympiad held dhaka residenti model colleg capit friday morn event presid hossain zillur rahman chairman organis committe former caretak govern advisor also present event fahmida khatun execut director centr polici dialogu cpd masrur arefin manag director citi bank sheikh mohammad maruf md dhaka bank mohammad ali md pubali bank among other hossain zillur rahman said “econom appli scienc ’s tri make econom popular school colleg level year particip bangladesh econom olympiad increas becom focal point attent year” fahmida khatun said “ growth rate increas per decad everyon benefit growth result inequ widen growth adequ creat employ youth unemploy increas past two half year peopl suffer high inflat economi driven onesid polit direct societi regresses” present keynot masrur arefin said perhap signific achiev past nine month corrupt irregular bank come halt money launder end big achiev polit unrest rise seventh edit event five particip award nation level among competitor across countri present smartphon laptop gift five will repres bangladesh intern econom olympiad azerbaijan"

"We are in the midst of challenges: Finance advisor","Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has said that they were in the midst of all sorts of challenges. ""Many criticise us, call us useless,"" he said, adding, ""It is fine if you criticise us, but this does not give a good impression to outside. It harms the image."" Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt.

When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt. Money laundering has ended. That is a big achievement. But political unrest is not the rise again.

"We are in the midst of challenges: Finance advisor","Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has said that they were in the midst of all sorts of challenges. ""Many criticise us, call us useless,"" he said, adding, ""It is fine if you criticise us, but this does not give a good impression to outside. It harms the image."" Speaking about the forthcoming budget, he said, ""There has been talk of all sorts of tax cuts. We will have to answer questions about all this the day after the budget. But it is not easy to determine the likes of the common man or social preferences.  This time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not impose what it wanted. We have reached a solution.""  Finance advisor Salehuddin Ahmed made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest  at the national finals of the Bangladesh Economics Olympiad 2025, held at Dhaka Residential Model College in the capital Friday morning,. The event was presided over by Hossain Zillur Rahman, chairman of the organising committee and former caretaker government advisor. Also present at the event were Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD); Masrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank; Sheikh Mohammad Maruf, MD of Dhaka Bank; and Mohammad Ali, MD of Pubali Bank, among others. Hossain Zillur Rahman said, “Economics is an applied science. That’s why we are trying to make economics popular from the school and college levels. This year there were 20,000 participants. Bangladesh Economics Olympiad is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention each year.” Fahmida Khatun said, “Our growth rate has increased by 1% per decade. But not everyone has benefited from this growth. As a result, inequality has widened. This growth has not been adequate in creating employment. Youth unemployment has increased. For the past two and a half years, people have been suffering from high inflation. When the economy is driven in a one-sided political direction, society regresses.” While presenting the keynote, Masrur Arefin said, perhaps there have not been significant achievements over the past nine months, but the corruption and irregularities in the banks have come to a halt.
